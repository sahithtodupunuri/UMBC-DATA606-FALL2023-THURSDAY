Client: Cell C Job Title: Big Data Engineer Job Duties:

Key Role in migration from Oracle to HDFS where transformation of Oracle ETLs/Procedures to Hadoop Ecosystem is done by using Hive with Tez and Python to minimize processing speed of data
Involved in loading and transforming large sets of structured data from relational databases into HDFS using Sqoop imports
Deployed and scheduled DAGs using Apache Airflow for workflow management and monitored them
Analyzed the data by performing Hive queries and solve the data discrepancy issues
Designed and implemented data models and ETL pipelines, improving data processing speed by 25%
Developed Sqoop scripts to import-export data between relational sources and HDFS
Automated Reconcilation Reports for Data validation
Worked on MS Power BI to make by making custom interactive and highly informative dashboards, visualizations
Working on improving the performance and optimization of the existing algorithms in Hadoop using Spark Context, Spark-SQL, Data Frame, Pair RDDs, Spark YARN.
Developed daily validation framework to check the source and loyalty transactions dataset.
ETL Pipelines that brings and transforms the huge volumes of data from different source systems Using Python Data Ingestion Pipelines.
Experience in managing and reviewing job and task log files and resolving the issues. Environment: Hadoop 2.7.2, HDFS2.7.2, Hive 2.3.2, MapReduce1.x, Spark 3.1.3, Yarn, Unix Academic Projects: Aircraft Delay Analysis
Used PySpark and MongoDB to process and analyze aircraft delay data, EDA was performed to gain insights into the data
Machine learning models were trained to predict flight delays based on various factors such as airline, origin, destination, time of day, and weather conditions.
Technologies used – Machine Learning, Python, PySpark Stock Forecast and Portfolio Optimization
Predicting the future prices of stocks by utilizing historical data from various sources.
The results have significant implications for investors, traders, and financial analysts, as it provides them with a valuable tool for making informed investment decisions
